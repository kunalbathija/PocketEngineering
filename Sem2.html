			<li>You would need tuitions if you don't have a good background in programming.</li>
			<li>Understand the codes. Never memorize anything. The exact same program may never comes in the exam.</li>
			<li>Scoring in this subject is easy once you know the gist of C language and how it works.</li>
			<li>This subject carries 5 credits. Your pointer will be affected if you don't score.</li>
			<li>Buy reference books like 'Programming in C by Pradeep Dey and Manas Ghosh' or 'Let Us C by ‘Yashwant Kanetkar’.Let us C is given in a very simple language and is very good if you need to know the concepts in detail.</li>
			<li>You really need to score in this subject if you're from the Computer Engineering stream. It'll be of much help in the coming semesters in subjects like Data Structures and Object Oriented Programming Methodology.</li>
			<li>There are many ways to write a code to solve a problem. You should write the ones you feel easiest to understand and concise.</li>
			<li>Writing comments beside the code in each line is a good habit which helps the corrector to understand your coding saving his time in correcting and gives you marks.</li>
			<li>Marks get cut for silly mistake due to missing out a ' ; ' semicolon in the end of the line. So always give a glance at your coding after writing.</li>
			<li>Those who opted for Computer Science as a Vocational Subject in XI and XII Standards will find this subject easy.</li>

			<li>You may or may not need tuitions for this subject. However, tuitions are recommended.</li>
			<li>You need to practice drawing a lot. Time is the biggest problem in exams and can be knocked out only by practicing.</li>
			<li>You'll get tired of drawing one day before the exams if you're slow. Start practising as soon as possible.</li>
			<li>This subject carries 5 credits. Your pointer will be affected if you don't score.</li>
			<li>'Engineering Drawing by N.H. Dubey' is the best book to buy.</li>
			<li>Alternative to that is a book by N.D. Bhatt.</li>
			<li>Choose between a roller scale and a drafter. They both do the same job. Select the one you find easy to handle. A small roller scale is better than a big one.</li>
			<li>Ensure enough space for your drawing. If paper falls small, you have no option but to erase it all and start again.</li>
			<li>Your measuring instruments should be clean. Rulers and protractors with fine dust or carbon film (due to keeping them with a bear pencil) would make your paper dirty if you use them.</li>
			<li>There are tricks to make your drawing complete faster which you'll find out yourself when you practice.</li>
			<li>Only your name and details (in assignments and exams) and nothing else should be written on the drawing sheets.</li>
			<li>You'll get lots of assignments to do from college. Better than grumbling about it, take it as a practice question. You'll regret not doing them yourself one day before the exam.</li>
			<li>The power of imagination plays an important role in Orthographic and Isometric projections. Forget the surrounding and just imagine the object. Hope that helps.</li>
			<li>People are scared of this subject. There's nothing to get scared of! Just be at your speed and avoid mistakes. Don't shiver in the exam due to time constraint.</li>
			<li>Projection of Points need not be studied for exams, it's not included in the blueprint.</li>
			<li>Projection of Straight lines is a very, very easy chapter and one question is sure to come. No one can stop you from scoring in it if you know the master diagram in it. See the master diagram in the chapter and relate it to your problem.</li>
			<li>Projection of Planes need not be studied for exams, it's not included in the blueprint.</li>
			<li>Projection of Solids is a very easy and important chapter. You need to imagine/think what to draw. Understand stages , perticularly initial stage, follow steps given. For going to next stage, one view to be rotated & the outer to be projected. Make sure that you rotated view correctly. There are 5 points, which will help you in projecting view.</li>
			<li>Orthographic Projections is a compulsory question in the end semester exam. It is easier than Isometric Projection. Moreover, the question is easy in the exam and it's a great loss if you lose marks because of this.</li>
			<li>Isometric Projections need imagination. If you find it really difficult and are not able to get correct projections, do Development of Surfaces nicely. See the blueprint and plan your study for the end semester exam.</li>
			<li>In the AutoCAD internal exam, place your name plate text box near to the drawing, not too far away. Take care it doesn't enter inside your drawing or you may lose marks.</li>
			<li>For AutoCAD practicle exam (external) three topics are given 1) Sec. Ortho 2) Isometric views or missing views (normally missing view is not asked).</li>

			<li>Clear out your confusions as soon as possible. Or you'll be looking at the paper with wide eyes open.</li>
			<li>This subject carries 5 credits. Your pointer will be affected if you don't score.</li>
			<li>Pracitse Maths in college in the lectures itself. Beleive me, this helps to save time for other theory subjects.</li>
			<li>Theory subjects are sometimes difficult to study in college because of the noise around in the classroom. Maths can be done at such times.</li>
			<li>90% of the students use G. V. Kumbhojkar for Maths which is known as the God of Maths books. Remember, Kumbhojkar is not an answer book. It's a text book where there are exercises unsolved with a few solved examples at the start.</li>
			<li>You can also refer to notes from classes since they carry problems important from exam point of view. If you're fine with Kumbhojkar, go for it.</li>
			<li>Differential Equations and Double Integration is all what is you need to study this time.</li>

			<li>Fibre Optics is an easy chapter to study.</li>
			<li>One of Schrodinger's Wave Equations (Time Independent/Dependent) is asked most of the times in the end semester exams. They just look dangerous, not difficult.</li>
