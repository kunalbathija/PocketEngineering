			<li>Like FE, Applied Mathematics in SE is a bonus subject.</li>
			<li>You dont need to put too many efforts to score well,just pay attention when it is taught in college.</li>
			<li>Classes are not necessary, but the later topics are at times not covered in college because of time constraints.You will have to do those yourself, or borrow class notes from someones.</li>
			<li>Kumbojhkar as we know is the God for MU Applied Mathematics.</li>
			<li>Last tip, make sure you go through past question papers thoroughly before exams, that would help a lot.This tip applies to all the other subjects for MU as well </li>

			<li>The subject is quite easy and interesting provided you understand the concepts, and scoring as well</li>
			<li>Though the concepts won't repeat as such, this subject will make future subjects like COA and Microprocessors easy for you.</li>
			<li>Since DLDA carries a lot of weightage, scoring good will drastically improve the pointerr.</li>
			<li>If you find concepts a little difficult, there is a channel called "Neso Academy"on Youtube, which has 10-12 mins really good videos and that will definitely clear up your concepts.</li>
			<li>R P Jain is the most preferred book, it is good though you can have techmax side by side to focus more on questions important from exam point of view.</li>
			<li>Classes arent needed, but it would be good if you get some good classes notes for reference.</li>

			<li>You can refer to Techmax or Kumbojhkar, but Kumbojhkar is too vast for some times and Techmax does have some mistakes.</li>
			<li>The best way is borrow notes from someone who goes to classes or sit down and make one yourself.</li>
			<li>Definitions and Solving Problems is important for exam.</li>
			<li>Make sure you are clear with the concepts because concepts like Hamiltonian Cycle will be used in AOA Sem4.</li>

			<li>Students find ECCF quite boring and unnecessary, but it carries a good weightage for pointer in Sem3.So even if you hate the subject you have to do it.</li>
			<li>This subject is totally theoretical,problems are there only in first few chapters. Also the subject isnt important for future for Computer students at all, so make sure you do not get a KT in this subject.</li>
			<li>D Roy Chaudhary is a good book, even Boylstead is good but it is vast.Some concepts are really good in Boylstead though Techmax would be a real saviour here.</li>
			<li>Atleast make sure you know the important concepts,if not everything.Viva is a night mare if you dont know the concepts.</li>
			<li>You can mug up at times if you have to.The latter part of ECCF is comparatively easy.</li>
			<li>It would be good if you would get notes of some good classes, but joining classes is unnecessary for this subject.</li>

			<li>Students find this subject difficult in the beginning but once you build a raport with it, you are going to love the subject!</li>
			<li>This is the most important subject and will be helpful for you for placements and even further studies.</li>
			<li>Classes are not really necessary, but better if you go because that would make your base of algorithms strong.Even if you dont go, Youtube has a lot of really good videos to help you out.</li>
			<li>Try to make your own notes such that you understand them and maintain them for future. If you could get xerox copy of notes from someone going to good classes, that would help too</li>
			<li>NEVER mug up things in this subject,Make sure you perform your practicals by yourself, only that will help you now and in the future.</li>
			<li>Techmax is useless, go for Reema Thareja.It has simple language as well as good concept clearance.</li>
			<li>Also, Yugchhaya ma'am teaches the subject really well! You are lucky if you get her for Data Structures.</li>
			<li>All the topics are important.But Pointers are going to be very confusing, but they are important.You should atleast know the basic use and concepts of Pointers.</li>
			<li>Linked Lists and Structures are also important because they will be needed for AOA in the next Semester.</li>
			<li>Don't worry even if your code doesnt execute during practical exam,Just keep trying and make sure you give your Viva well.</li>

			<li>This is the most important subject, not for MU but for placements and Coding, but it is given the least weightage and least importance</li>
			<li>Java as a language is used almost everywhere, so it would be better if you join classes for the subject as it will help you cover the MU syllabus as well as cover the extra necessary concepts, plus the classes notes will help you during placements.</li>
			<li>Even if you dont go to classes, atleast make sure you borrow someones classes notes or there are even good Youtube videos that will help you out like Saurabh Shukla Sir's channel/</li>
			<li>Try to carry out the practicals by yourself that will help in the practical exam as well as Viva.Students generally get stuck with concepts like Multi Threading and Exceptions, but you can clear them out,they're not that difficult.</li>
			<li>Do not mug up this subject, it is a sin for Computer students.</li>
			<li>Do not mug up this subject, it is a sin for Computer students.</li>
			<li>Though there is no written exam for OOPM, you will have a Mini Project at the end of the Semester.Try to make the Mini Project yourself and start a little earlier, that way you can learn and make project yourself.</li>
			<li>Focus more on Java, because that's what is going to be important for your future!</li>
