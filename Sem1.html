			<li>Tutions are preferrable since you are introduced to this subject for the first time and concepts need to be given time to understand.</li>
			<li>There's no limit to problems in Mechanics.</li>
			<li>The best book to buy is 'Engineering Mechanics by M.D. Dayal'.</li>
			<li>This subject carries 6 credits. Your pointer will be affected if you don't score well.</li>
			<li>It'll be difficult for you to clear it if you get a K.T. in the subject. Clear it in your very first attempt.</li>
			<li>Dynamics is more difficult than Statics. In dynamics, you need to think about the situation of the question, choose the correct formulae and solve.</li>
			<li>Statics is comparatively easy because the basic thing is to equate the sum of all forces to the resultant force to solve the problem. You don't need to think much.</li>
			<li>You must've done Friction in earlier standards and this makes statics easier.</li>

			<li>Tuitions are recommended.</li>
			<li>Solve as many problems as you can from DC Circuits - with mixed up concepts.</li>
			<li>Solving many problems at the same time of the same concept makes your brain in one way only. After studying all methods and theorems, solve questions mixed questions of different concepts. This will make you thorough with the chapter.</li>
			<li>This subject carries 5 credits. Your pointer will be affected if you don't score.</li>
			<li>DC Circuits and Single-Phase AC Circuits are of more importance.</li>

			<li>You may/may not need to go to tuitions for Maths.</li>
			<li>If you donâ€™t practice be ready for a downfall.</li>
			<li>Just knowing how to solve is not enough. Earlier, maths could be done to some extent in exams by just looking at formulae. Now it's not.</li>
			<li>This subject carries 5 credits. Your pointer will be affected if you don't score.</li>
			<li>Pracitce Maths in college in the lectures itself. Beleive me, this helps to save time for other theory subjects.</li>
			<li>Theory subjects are sometimes difficult to study in college because of the noise around in the classroom. Maths can be done at such times.</li>
			<li>Module 2, i.e., Matrices and Numerical Methods is very easy compared to other modules in the rest of the portion. Don't lose marks in matrices.</li>
			<li>90% of the students use G. V. Kumbhojkar for Maths which is known as the God of Maths books. Remember, Kumbhojkar is not an answer book. It's a text book where there are exercises unsolved with a few solved examples at the start.</li>
			<li>You can also refer notes from classes ,they help since they have questions important from exam point of view. If you're fine with Kumbhojkar, go for it.</li>
			<li>Preferably go for Kumojhkar updated edition</li>
