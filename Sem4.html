			<li>Data structures of Sem III was the basics for this subject.</li>
			<li>If your data structures isnt clear consider going to classes or refer Youtube videos of Abdul Bari(really really helpful) or Ravindrababu Ravula.</li>
			<li>The problem solving concepts from this subject are important from exam point of view.</li>
			<li>Mugging up would be sin, go through videos/concepts, only that will help.</li>
			<li>Try to make your own notes for this subject, it will definitely help.If you are too lazy atleast borrow classes notes for reference.</li>
			<li>Online material would help.Reference books like Coreman are too vast.</li>
			<li>Make sure you perform Practicals on your own, otherwise wait for your fate during practical exam.The experiments really need time to understand.</li>
			<li>You will have elective subjects in Sem V, You will have to decide which subject you like from AOA and OS by then.</li>

			<li>This is entirely a theory subject</li>
			<li>It will help in Microprocessors in next semester.</li>
			<li>Actually the subject is not that important as far as placements are concerned, but the required concepts for placements will be covered in later semesters.</li>
			<li>Dont mug up concepts, understand and learn, refer youtube videos, they are the best.</li>
			<li>No classes needed at all.</li>
			<li>Techmax is sufficient for exams, if you want more go for stallings.</li>

			<li>This is the easiest subject of Sem IV.</li>
			<li>It primarily teaches about how Graphics works on a computer on a primitive level .</li>
			<li>This subject is of no use in semesters ahead, so its better to focus more on other important subjects.</li>
			<li>Techmax is sufficient for exams, except for algorithms and numercials which are much better and accurately given in Rajesh Maurya.</li>
			<li>You can always surf for youtube videos to make concepts clear.</li>

			<li>This is one of the core subjects for placements.</li>
			<li>Not too difficult it teaches you things about OS you probably never knew before on Linux OS.</li>
			<li>Classes are not necessary at all, because the subject is self explanatory.</li>
			<li>As a computer enginner you should be aware how OSs work and so you cannot take this subject lightly at all.</li>
			<li>Techmax is the best for this subject, but Galvin is even better with all concepts properly explained.</li>
			<li>You will have a mini project for OS at the end of the semester, choose your topic such that it is not too time consuming yet not too simple, you maybe asked about it in placement interviews.</li>

			<li>Python is given the least importance, but it is the most important subject in Sem IV.</li>
			<li>Portion covered in college is basic, try to learn further from outside/online.</li>
			<li>You will love Python once Practicals starts.</li>
			<li>Our syllabus also has basics of Perl,which will be covered at the end of the semester.</li>
			<li>Nageswarrao is a good reference book for basics and Viva Preparation.</li>
			<li>Make sure you perform all the practicals yourself, that will really help you.</li>
			<li>There is a Mini Project at the end of the semester, you can choose any topic concerning python you want,in short you will have a wide range to choose from,make the use of this oppurtunity and do the project yourself, you might be asked about it during placements.</li>
